## Overview
Lean Node.js backend for hands-on practice and skill deepening. Start basic, expand into scalable APIs (e.g., user auth, e-commerce). Focus: modern stack, modularity, and iterative learning.

## Tech Stack
Node.js + TypeScript: Typed, efficient runtime.
Express.js: Fast API framework.
Sequelize + PostgreSQL: ORM for relational DB ops.
(Later: Docker, Jest, JWT, Redis.)
